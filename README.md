# Minecraft Server Status Discord Bot
Give your players a way to see if your Minecraft server are online using /ping

### THIS BRANCH IS DEPRECATED 
This branch is deprecated because it's old. I've come to the conclusion that the original reason for the bot was for the status message command. Not a full bot that does other things not related to what this bot currently does. Therefore, this branch that has a base for a more diverse bot, will be not be updated anymore. However, this branch will stay for those who want to take a look at how a more complex bot would look like.

### IMPORTANT NOTE!
This is where I develop the bot, a lot of stuff may not work and are constantly changing. If you find any problems then please tell me!
To find a stable version, go to the [Master Branch](https://github.com/TheCactusMonkey/MinecraftServer-DiscordBot/tree/master).

Thanks :D
